# Brian's Fabulous User List

The initial coding assessment for a Web Developer role at Microsoft, forked from react-interview-q1.

## Description

This is a simple list app with a form designed to add name/location combinations to the list, and it utilizes a combination of React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is also designed to utilize the APIs provided to validate the name input field and pull a list of locations that populate the Location dropdown.

## Features

- User can add an unlimited number of Name/Location combinations
- A 'Clear' button that will erase the list
- Name input field validation that will throw an error if the field is empty and if the name in the field already exists in the list
- Name input field continuously validates on the fly as the user types in the field
- An 'Add' button that will disable if there are errors in the name input field
- Two API calls that will validate the name input field and pull a list of locations that populate the Location dropdown
- App is fully responsive and will shrink/expand and adjust padding/margins/gutters based on viewport width
